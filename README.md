## 📌 Project Vision
NetraAI is a revolutionary vision-based AI system designed to make knowledge instantly accessible and conversational for all humans.

## 🎯 Core Objective
Design a wearable AI assistant that listens, observes, and assists in real time — a digital Hanuman: wise, contextual, and available.

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High-Level)
- Input Layer: Vision, Voice
- Contextual Core: Prompt engine, memory, context filter
- Knowledge Engine: Hybrid (local + cloud)
- Output Layer: Voice + AR overlay

## 📂 Files and Structure (Proposed)
- [`src/ai_core/`]()
- [`docs/`]()
- [`design/`]()
- [`demo/`]()

## 🚀 Roadmap
- V1: README, architecture
- V2: AR emulator prototype
- V3: Wearable-ready assistant

## 🤝 Call for Collaboration
